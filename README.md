# Convergence

### What is it?

Convergence is a aggregation platform for content published on Graphite Publishing. Anyone who publishes on Graphite Publishing has the option to include their posts on Convergence. In doing so, the post will be displayed at convergence.app but will always link out to the user's specific blog site. 

### Why does it exist? 

Medium is a content aggregation platform with a goal of eventually turning a profit. As such, writers do not truly own their content and readers have to put up with constant pop-ups, veiled ads, and distracting notifications. Convergence strives to give people an outlet for content discovery. Readers can simply click through the blog posts aggregated on Convergence without ever worrying about ads or popups. Writers can take comfort in knowing that because the writing they post there is created and stored in their own Graphite Publishing instance that the content is actually theirs. 

### Who built it?

Convergence is a product of [Graphite](https://graphitedocs.com) and [Graphite Publishing](https://publishing.graphitedocs.com).
